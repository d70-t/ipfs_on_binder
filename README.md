# IPFS on binder

This repository is intended to demonstrate the use of IPFS on binder.

The repository will install an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) node within a binder environment and connects it to the IPFS network. It is subsequently possible to retrieve content from the IPFS network through that local node.

There's also a tiny demo-notebook which shows the retrieval of an image: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/d70-t/ipfs_on_binder/HEAD?labpath=IPFS%20retrieval%20demo.ipynb)
